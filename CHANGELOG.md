### Major Themes

#### Providers storage

Providers now fetch resources and store them in their local storage.
This expands to ingress fetching. It is no longer happening on i2gw package and moved to be fetched at the provider level.

#### New Providers

Istio and APISIX support has been added.
To check what features are currently supported please visit [Istio](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/i2gw/providers/istio/README.md) and [APIXIS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway/blob/v0.2.0/pkg/i2gw/providers/apisix/README.md).

- Kong supports `ImplementationSpecific` as `PathType` and converts it into `RegularExpression.` (#89, @mlavacca)
- Move ingress fetching logic to be isolated, per provider (#116, @LiorLieberman)
- New Apache APISIX provider. (#108, @pottekkat)
- Print generated GatewayClasses, TLSRoutes, TCPRoutes and ReferenceGrants in addition to Gateways and HTTPRoutes (#110, @dpasiukevich)
- The `HTTPRoutes` are named with the following pattern: <ingress-name>-<name-from-host>. (#79, @mlavacca)
- [Istio provider] set up code for reading istio custom resources (#99, @dpasiukevich)

### Bug or Regression

- Skip k8s client creation when reading local file. (#128, @dpasiukevich)
